# Career System

**Status:** Verified in-game (2026-04-14). Career button with sprite on Character Developer screen, GameState-based screen opening (no crash), career selection in Character Creation. Gondor campaign tested.

## Overview

Career/class progression system where each hero can have a career that provides passive bonuses, an active ability, and a 3-tier choice tree. 50 LOTR-themed careers across 16 factions, fully XML-driven. Each career has 31 choices (1 root + 6 groups x 5 choices) with keystones, passives, and ability mutations.

## Why This Exists

- **Vanilla behavior:** Bannerlord has perks but no career/class system with branching choice trees or active abilities
- **TAOM requirement:** Middle-earth factions need distinct playstyles beyond cultural feats — a Mordor Warboss should feel different from a Gondor Knight
- **Without this feature:** All heroes of the same culture play identically after initial perk selection

## Architecture

### Design Challenge

TOR_Core's career system uses hardcoded C# classes, static singletons, and 6 Harmony patches on ViewModel. TAOM needs XML-driven careers (add without recompilation), DryIoc injection, adapter pattern compliance, and UIExtenderEx integration.

### Solution Approach

- **Data model:** Plain C# classes (not PropertyObject) loaded from XML via `ICareerConfigProvider`
- **Persistence:** `CareerPersistenceBehavior` with `SyncData("_taom_careerData")` storing `Dictionary<string, HeroCareerData>`
- **Passive application:** `ICareerPassiveService` caches per-hero effect magnitudes, `CareerPassiveHelper` wires into 8 existing GameModels
- **Mutations:** Hybrid XML + C# calculator registry — XML defines target/params, C# provides calculator functions by ID
- **UI:** `GauntletCareerScreen` with `CareerScreenVM` hierarchy (TOR-pattern expandable panels, portraits, ability icons, lock chains), `CharacterDeveloperCareerMixin` (UIExtenderEx) for career button with sprite. See [gui-sprite-system.md](gui-sprite-system.md) for full UI details.
- **Battle:** `CareerPerkMissionBehavior` for per-second tick, kill/damage charge via `OnScoreHit`, `CareerAbilityService` for ability state
- **Ability effects:** `CareerAbilityEffectRegistry` dispatches to per-career `ICareerAbilityEffectExecutor` implementations. 3 role-based archetypes (Infantry/Ranged/Cavalry) serve all 50 careers with XML-tunable values via `taom_ability_tuning.xml`. Infantry buffs all nearby troops (AoE damage + damage reduction), Ranged buffs self (speed + ranged damage + draw speed), Cavalry buffs self + mount (mount speed + charge damage + damage). Buffs applied via `CareerAbilityBuffTracker` with separate hero and ally buff dictionaries (read by `TaomAgentStatCalculateModel` — survives stat recalc).

## Configuration

### Career Definitions (`Main/_Module/ModuleData/career_system/taom_careers.xml`)

Defines careers with: id, display name, description, ability template ID, charge type, max charge, eligible cultures, choice group IDs. `max_perk_points` attribute on root element (default 30).

### Choice Trees (`Main/_Module/ModuleData/career_system/taom_career_choices.xml`)

Defines standalone root choices and choice groups. Each group has a tier (1/2/3) and contains choices (Keystone or Passive). Choices can have PassiveEffect (type + magnitude + operation) and Mutations (target template + property + calculator + params).

### Ability Templates (`Main/_Module/ModuleData/career_system/taom_ability_templates.xml`)

Defines career abilities with: id, name, cooldown, duration, radius, cast type, target type, particle/sound effects.

## How-To

### Add a new career
1. Add `<Career>` element to `taom_careers.xml` with unique id, eligible cultures, choice groups
2. Add `<ChoiceGroup>` elements to `taom_career_choices.xml` (6 groups: 2 per tier, each with 1 keystone + 4 passives)
3. Add `<Choice id="xxx_root">` as the root choice
4. Add ability template to `taom_ability_templates.xml`
5. No C# changes required

### Add a new mutation calculator
1. Add function to `BuiltInCalculators.RegisterAll()`
2. Reference by id in XML `<Mutation calculator="your_id" ... />`

### Add a new PassiveEffectType
1. Add enum value to `PassiveEffectType.cs`
2. Add `CareerPassiveHelper.ApplyFactor/ApplyFlat` call in the relevant GameModel
