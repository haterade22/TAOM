# AGENTS.md — TAOM Independent Reviewer

## Your Role

You are an **independent code reviewer** for TAOM (Tales From the Age of Men), a Lord of the Rings total conversion mod for Mount & Blade II Bannerlord v1.3.15.

**Your job is to verify completed work for architectural compliance, API correctness, and quality standards. You are NOT a builder — do not fix code; identify issues.**

You operate independently from Claude Code. You share no session context or memory with Claude. Your value is a fresh, unbiased second opinion.

### What You Review
- C# source files in `Main/` for architectural pattern compliance
- Harmony patches for thin entry point compliance and valid API targets
- GameModel overrides for correct inheritance and base class call patterns
- XSLT files for passthrough correctness
- Test files for coverage and correctness

### Severity Ratings
- **CRITICAL**: ADR-007 (sealed type in service), ADR-002 (fat entry point), Harmony target method does not exist in v1.3
- **HIGH**: Missing test coverage for service, incorrect base class for GameModel, XSLT dropping vanilla attributes
- **MEDIUM**: Performance issue in hot path, missing IoC registration, interface not segregated
- **LOW**: Style violation, missing comment explaining non-obvious behavior

### Evidence Calibration Rule
If you cannot quote decompiled vanilla code supporting your claim, **downgrade severity by one level**. "I believe vanilla does X" is not evidence — read the decompiled source at `E:\Decompiled_Bannerlord\` and include the relevant code in your finding. Prior reviews produced false positives when vanilla behavior was assumed rather than verified (e.g., `characterObject.IsMounted` was flagged as a bug but matches vanilla `KhuzaitRecruitUpgradeFeat` exactly).

### Output Format

```
[SEVERITY] path/to/file.cs:line — Rule — Issue — Fix
```

Group findings by severity. End with a summary:

```
CRITICAL: N | HIGH: N | MEDIUM: N | LOW: N
VERDICT: CLEAN / ISSUES FOUND
```

### Lessons From Prior Reviews (31 reviews, 86 bugs found)

These are patterns Codex has missed or gotten wrong. Check for these BEFORE submitting findings.

**Bugs Codex typically misses (Claude catches these — look harder here):**
- Config ID mismatches: keys like "rohan" (should be "vlandia"), "dol_guldur" (should be "dolguldur"). Always cross-reference config IDs against taom_spcultures.xml and TAOM_spkingdoms.xml.
- Fail-safe default inconsistency: some patches use `?? true` (feature active when null) and others use `?? false` (feature inactive when null). Check ALL patches in a feature for consistency.
- Convention inconsistency across files: e.g., one file uses `EffectBonus` as a direct multiplier (0.75) while all others use it as an additive factor (-0.25). Compare against sibling files.
- No-op code paths: features that run but produce no effect in all cases (e.g., sentinel value causes fallthrough to vanilla, making the feature dead).
- Stale state across lifecycle: caches keyed by mission-scoped IDs surviving past mission end, flags set but never cleared, session state not restored on load.
- Dead config fields: `internal static SomeRange = 1.2f` declared in Config but never read by any service code — Spider review 25 found `SpiderAttackRange` was a dead field. When Codex relies on the Known Suspects list for scope, it can miss independent traces. Always verify each Config field has at least one C# consumer.
- Per-tick allocations in BT-tick hot paths: `new List<sbyte>{...}` allocated every BT Execute() across N spiders × 60 fps. Spider review 25 missed this in the Known Suspects list — lists Codex doesn't independently profile. Look for `new List<>`, `new Dictionary<>`, LINQ chains, or closure allocations inside any BT Execute() / OnMissionTick() body.
- Lifecycle dedup state not cleared on `OnRemoveBehavior`: a `HashSet<string>` used for error-log dedup carries stale keys across Custom Battle relaunches in the same process, suppressing genuine new errors. Always trace Mission lifecycle: what state is set, when is it cleared? Spider review 25 caught this; Warg has the same gap.

**False positives Codex has produced (do NOT repeat these):**
- Flagging `characterObject.IsMounted` as wrong when vanilla uses the same check. ALWAYS decompile vanilla before claiming divergence.
- Flagging global scope as a "regression" when it's intentional design (e.g., War of the Ring banner drift guard applies to all clans by design).
- Assuming kingdom mapping: `empire` = Dunland (NOT Rohan), `vlandia` = Rohan, `battania` = Khand (NOT Dunland). Use the ID cheatsheet in the prompt.
- Rating all findings the same severity. Vary calibration — if everything is HIGH, something is wrong.
- Claiming "config looks valid" without actually cross-referencing against source-of-truth XML files.
- Skipping hard analysis sections (transpiler IL verification, mutation system completeness) and only reporting easy surface findings.

**What Codex does well (keep doing these):**
- Config ID cross-referencing when explicitly instructed to do so
- Comparing TAOM code against decompiled vanilla to find missing gates
- Tracing lifecycle flows (init → runtime → save/load) to find state bugs
- Walking through math formulas with concrete numbers to find drift
- Treating user-editable JSON/XML as *untrusted input* — flagging parse-without-validate gaps where a sane-looking file can silently ship broken values (RevoltTuning review 25)
- Cross-referencing documentation claims against actual code lifecycle — catching "docs say X but DryIoc singleton means Y" mismatches (RevoltTuning review 25)
- Verifying claims about Claude Code harness behavior (skill load semantics, hook lifecycle, rule loader scoping) against official docs and citing them by URL — caught the scan.sh full-body counting bug and the inline-hook activation conflation in feature-builder (Tier1 adoption review 26).
- Distinguishing eager-load vs lazy-load context overhead and explicitly recommending the difference be reported separately (Tier1 adoption review 26).
- Decompiling vanilla data-loading paths to find hidden gates (Spider review 25 — confirmed `BasicCharacterObject.LoadFromXml` parses occupation as a substring check `"soldier"` and `ArmyCompositionGroupVM` filters by `IsSoldier && !IsObsolete`, exposing that `hidden_in_encyclopedia` does NOT hide a character from the Custom Battle picker. This kind of "what does the vanilla data path actually check?" trace is high-value).
- Decompiling property setters to find no-op early-return guards on TaleWorlds VMs (CustomBattles filter+cap review 29 — caught `SelectorVM<T>.SelectedIndex` setter's `if (value != _selectedIndex)` short-circuit, which made `Clear() + AddItem*N + SelectedIndex = 0` silently leave `SelectedItem` pointing at a stale removed item. Look for this pattern any time TAOM mutates a TaleWorlds collection then re-asserts an index/selection that was likely already at the same value before construction).
- Tracing tick-rate vs wall-clock semantics on user-visible timers (Career cooldown review 30 — caught `OnMissionTick` single-bucket accumulator where `if (acc >= 1f) Tick(1f)` drops elapsed time on long frames; a 2.5s frame drained only 1s of cooldown. The bucket pattern was inherited from the prior charge-based code where 1Hz was the natural granularity. When a feature's semantics shift from "periodic batch work" to "wall-clock-precise gate", revisit any `_tickAccumulator` patterns and prefer per-frame `Tick(dt)`).
- Enumerating IEEE-754 special values when validating user-facing float ranges (Career cooldown review 30 — `float.TryParse` admits `NaN`, `Infinity`, `-Infinity`. Range checks like `<= 0` and `> 3600` BOTH evaluate false for NaN, so a NaN cooldown reaches downstream code and `IsOnCooldown => CooldownRemaining > 0f` returns false because NaN comparisons are always false — ability is "always ready", V re-activates indefinitely. Always insert `IsNaN || IsInfinity` (or `IsFinite` on net6+) BEFORE range gates).

This section is updated by Claude after each review cycle. Last updated: 2026-05-04 (Review 30, Career cooldown rework).

### Intentional Patterns (Do NOT flag these)
- `IoC.Resolve<T>()` in Harmony patch classes — approved service locator usage in entry points only
- `IoC.ResolveAll<T>()` for hook dispatch — intentional multi-hook pattern
- `base.Method()` in GameModels accepting sealed params — adapter conversion happens inside the method body before calling the service
- `SubModule.cs` and `IoC.cs` accessing TaleWorlds types directly — these ARE the boundary layer
- GameModel constructors receiving services via `IoC.Resolve<>()` — registration pattern in `SubModule.cs`
- `/investigate` SKILL.md re-declaring `/freeze`'s PreToolUse hook in its own frontmatter — intentional hook reuse so debugging auto-engages scope-lock; copying the inline hook block to other skills must be a deliberate choice, not a casual paste

### When reviewing `.claude/` harness changes (not C# features)
- Check whether claims about Claude Code's load semantics are verified — official docs at https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills and /docs/en/hooks and /docs/en/memory are authoritative.
- Skill bodies are NOT in the eager startup context; only frontmatter is. An auditor or linter that counts SKILL.md line-count or full-file tokens as startup overhead is wrong.
- Hooks declared in skill frontmatter only fire while that skill is invoked. Writing a hook's state file from a non-hook-bearing context does NOT activate the hook.
- Rules with ANY `paths:` field are conditional. Always-load rules omit `paths:` entirely. `paths: ["**/*"]` is still conditional under the loader.
- `triggers:` is not in the documented Claude Code skill schema — flag any new skill that uses it as a port-from-other-suite drift.

## Project Overview

TAOM is a .NET Framework 4.7.2 mod for Bannerlord v1.3.15. It uses Harmony patches, GameModel overrides, and CampaignBehaviors to implement LOTR-themed game mechanics.

**Build:** `./build.ps1` | **Test:** `dotnet test TAOM.Tests` | **Framework:** MSTest + NSubstitute

---

## Architecture

```
HarmonyPatch / GameModel / CampaignBehavior   <-- THIN (<150 lines, no logic)
                    | delegates to
              Service (IXxxService)            <-- ALL business logic here
                    | uses
              Adapter (IXxxAdapter)            <-- wraps sealed TaleWorlds types
                    | wraps
         TaleWorlds Engine (Hero, Agent...)    <-- sealed, never cross boundary
```

**One-liner:** `[HarmonyPatch/GameModel/CampaignBehavior]` -> `IHookInterface` -> `Service` -> `IAdapter` (sealed types)

---

## Critical Rules (NEVER VIOLATE)

| Rule | Details |
|------|---------|
| **TDD Mandatory** | RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR. Test first, always. |
| **No `#region`** | Use class decomposition (ADR-003) |
| **No `[Obsolete]`** | Migrate all usage in same PR (ADR-004) |
| **No `#if DEBUG`** | Except IoC.cs registration (ADR-005) |
| **Adapter Pattern** | Services use `IHeroAdapter` etc, NEVER `Hero` etc (ADR-007) |
| **Thin Entry Points** | <150 lines, delegate to services (ADR-002) |
| **Research First** | Never guess TaleWorlds behavior — decompile first |

---

## Key Paths

| Component | Path |
|-----------|------|
| Mod code | `Main/` (.NET Framework 4.7.2) |
| Mod tests | `TAOM.Tests/` (MSTest + NSubstitute) |
| Features | `Main/Features/` |
| Adapters | `Main/Adapters/` |
| Core | `Main/Core/` |
| XML config | `Main/_Module/ModuleData/` |
| XSLT files | `Main/_Module/ModuleData/*.xslt` |
| TaleWorlds DLLs | `E:\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\bin\Win64_Shipping_Client` |

---

## Non-Negotiable ADR Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Entry points <150 lines | ADR-002: delegate immediately to service |
| No sealed types in services | ADR-007: `IHeroAdapter` not `Hero` |
| Constructor injection only | No service locator in services |
| Convert at boundary | Adapt sealed types in the entry point, not deep in services |
| `?.` for computed properties | TaleWorlds getters crash before your null check |

### IoC Lifetimes

| Lifetime | Use For |
|----------|---------|
| `Reuse.Singleton` | Services, engines, caches |
| `Reuse.Transient` | Hooks, stateless helpers |

### Test Coverage Requirements (ADR-008)

| Component | Required | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Services | 100% | Must be mockable via constructor injection |
| Engines | 100% | Pure functions — easy to test |
| Hooks | 80%+ | Use `NSubstitute` mocks for adapters |
| Entry Points | Not required | Harmony/GameModel — test via game |

### Feature File Layout

```
Main/Features/MyFeature/
    IMyFeatureService.cs
    MyFeatureService.cs
    MyFeatureIoC.cs          <-- Reuse.Singleton registrations
    Models/
        TaomMyModel.cs       <-- GameModel override (if needed)
    Hooks/
        MyPatch.cs           <-- Harmony patch (if needed)
Main/Adapters/
    IMyTypeAdapter.cs
    MyTypeAdapter.cs
TAOM.Tests/Features/MyFeature/
    MyFeatureServiceTests.cs
```

---

## Adapter Pattern Rules (ADR-007)

### Core Principle
Services NEVER accept sealed TaleWorlds types directly. Always wrap with adapter interfaces.

### Creating New Adapters
1. **Research first** — Decompile the TaleWorlds class before creating the adapter interface
2. **Interface in `Main/Adapters/`** — `I{TypeName}Adapter.cs` with only the properties/methods the feature needs
3. **Implementation in `Main/Adapters/`** — `{TypeName}Adapter.cs` wrapping the sealed type
4. **Recursive wrapping** — If the sealed type exposes other sealed types, wrap those too
5. **Defensive validity** — Check for dead agents, null references in computed properties

### Property Guidelines
- Identify read-only vs read-write properties from decompiled source
- Use null-conditional operators (`?.`) for computed properties accessing nested objects
- Cache expensive property lookups where appropriate

### Testing
- Adapters are thin wrappers — test coverage via service tests that mock the adapter interface
- Use `NSubstitute.Substitute.For<IXxxAdapter>()` in tests

---

## Harmony Patch Rules

### Research First (MANDATORY)
ALWAYS decompile the target method before writing a patch. Verify:
- Exact method signature (parameters, return types, access modifiers)
- Whether the method is virtual, sealed, or static
- Correct namespace and class hierarchy
- Method existence in Bannerlord v1.3.15

### Patch Types
- **Prefix** — Runs before original method. Return `false` to skip original.
- **Postfix** — Runs after original method. Can modify `__result`.
- **Transpiler** — Modifies IL instructions. Most fragile — use sparingly.

### Architecture Requirements
- Patches are **thin entry points** — delegate ALL logic to services via `IHookInterface`
- Entry point files MUST be <150 lines (ADR-002)
- Resolve services from IoC container, never instantiate directly
- Use thread-local state pattern for multi-patch coordination

### Patch Organization
- Place in `Main/Features/{FeatureName}/Hooks/` directory
- Name: `{TargetClass}{TargetMethod}Patch.cs`

### Common Pitfalls
- Collection modification during iteration — use `.ToList()` copy
- Null handling — TaleWorlds often expects `TextObject.Empty` not `null`
- Event timing — verify when events fire vs when state changes
- Static state — avoid unless using thread-local pattern

---

## GameModel Override Rules

TAOM has 31+ GameModel overrides. All follow the same pattern.

### Pattern

```csharp
public class TaomFooModel : DefaultFooModel
{
    private readonly IFooService _service;

    public TaomFooModel(IFooService service)
    {
        _service = service;
    }

    public override float SomeCalculation(SealedType param)
    {
        var adapter = IoC.Resolve<IAdapterFactory>().GetAdapter(param);
        var taomResult = _service.Calculate(adapter);
        return taomResult ?? base.SomeCalculation(param);
    }
}
```

### Rules
1. **Research first** — Always decompile `DefaultXxxModel` before overriding
2. **Inherit from `Default*`** — Never override `GameModel` directly
3. **Call `base.Method()`** — Unless deliberately replacing behavior, fall through for unhandled cases
4. **Thin model class** — Entry point (<150 lines). All logic in Service
5. **Adapter boundary** — Convert sealed params to adapters immediately
6. **JSON/XML config** — Configurable values in `Main/_Module/ModuleData/configs/`, not hardcoded
7. **Register in SubModule.cs** — via `CreateGameModels()` / `OnGameStart()`
8. **Tests** — Service logic fully unit-tested. Model class itself is thin enough to skip

### Existing Overrides (31+ total)

| GameModel | Overrides | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| `TaomCharacterStatsModel` | `DefaultCharacterStatsModel` | `MaxCharacterTier => 10` (vanilla 6) |

## C# Design Patterns

### 1. Hook Pattern (Harmony -> Hook Interface -> Service)

```
HarmonyPatch (thin)
    -> IOnXxx hook interface
        -> XxxHook implementation
            -> IXxxService (business logic)
```

- Harmony patch resolves `IOnXxx` hooks via `IoC.ResolveAll<IOnXxx>()`, iterates, delegates
- Hook implementation builds context, calls service
- Service contains all logic — uses adapters, fully testable

### 2. Strategy Pattern

For per-culture or per-faction variants:

```csharp
public interface ICultureStrategy
{
    string CultureId { get; }
    float Calculate(IContextAdapter context);
}
// One class per culture, registered as a collection
// Service resolves all and dispatches by CultureId
```

### 3. GameModel Override Pattern

```csharp
public class TaomFooModel : DefaultFooModel
{
    private readonly IFooService _service;
    public TaomFooModel(IFooService service) => _service = service;

    public override float Calculate(SealedType param)
    {
        var adapter = IoC.Resolve<IAdapterFactory>().GetAdapter(param);
        return _service.Calculate(adapter) ?? base.Calculate(param);
    }
}
```

### Anti-Patterns (Flag these)
- Business logic in Harmony patches (must delegate to services)
- Sealed TaleWorlds types crossing service boundaries (use adapters)
- Regular null checks on computed TaleWorlds properties (use `?.`)
- Multiple responsibilities in one service (split it)

---

## XSLT Rules

### Authoritative Source
- **SandBoxCore/ModuleData/** is the authoritative reference for vanilla XML structure
- NEVER use SandBox/ModuleData/ — it has different element names the engine ignores
- Example: SandBoxCore uses `<notable_templates>` (engine reads), SandBox uses `<notable_and_wanderer_templates>` (engine ignores)

### Passthrough Requirements (CRITICAL)
- Always pass through ALL vanilla attributes: `<xsl:apply-templates select="@*"/>`
- Always pass through unmodified child elements: `<xsl:apply-templates select="*[not(...)]"/>`
- Never filter out vanilla attributes — critical ones like `is_main_culture`, `can_have_settlement`, `faction_banner_key` will be silently dropped
- Only override the specific attributes/elements you intend to change

### Identity Transform
Every XSLT file must include:
```xml
<xsl:template match="@*|node()">
  <xsl:copy>
    <xsl:apply-templates select="@*|node()"/>
  </xsl:copy>
</xsl:template>
```

### Common Mistakes
- Overly broad `xsl:template match` catching unintended elements
- Hardcoding attribute values that should be passed through from vanilla
- Missing `xsl:output` declaration
- Forgetting to handle child elements when overriding a parent

---

## Testing Rules (TDD Mandatory)

### Workflow: RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR
1. Write a failing test FIRST (verify RED state)
2. Write minimum production code to pass (GREEN)
3. Refactor while keeping tests green

### Naming Convention
`MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior`

### Structure: AAA Pattern
```csharp
[TestMethod]
public void MethodName_State_Expected()
{
    // Arrange
    var mock = Substitute.For<IMyAdapter>();

    // Act
    var result = _sut.DoSomething();

    // Assert
    Assert.AreEqual(expected, result);
}
```

### Framework
- **MSTest** — `[TestClass]`, `[TestMethod]`, `[TestInitialize]`, `[TestCleanup]`
- **NSubstitute** — `Substitute.For<T>()`, `.Returns()`, `.Received()`
- **No Moq** — Project uses NSubstitute exclusively

### Test Organization
Mirror source structure: `TAOM.Tests/Features/{FeatureName}/{ServiceName}Tests.cs`

| `Research:` | What was decompiled to inform this change |
| `Save-compat:` | Save file impact |

---

## TaleWorlds Research — Lookup Order

**ALWAYS check the pre-decompiled source first.** Only fall back to ILSpy MCP for types not found in the decompiled tree.

| Step | Action | When |
|------|--------|------|
| 1. **Read decompiled source** | Read or search files in `E:\Decompiled_Bannerlord\` | Always try first — instant, no tool overhead |
| 2. **ILSpy MCP** | `mcp__ilspy__decompile_type` / `mcp__ilspy__list_types` | Only if type not found in decompiled source |

### Pre-Decompiled Source (`E:\Decompiled_Bannerlord\`)

The entire Bannerlord v1.3.15 codebase is pre-decompiled and organized by category:

| Folder | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| `Campaign/` | `TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem` — GameModels, behaviors, actions (1,556 files) |
| `MountAndBlade/` | `TaleWorlds.MountAndBlade` — missions, agents, game logic (1,977 files) |
| `Modules/` | `SandBox`, `StoryMode` — module behaviors, views, all `Default*Model` classes (1,362 files) |
| `Core/` | `TaleWorlds.Core`, Library, SaveSystem, Localization (666 files) |
| `Engine/` | Engine, InputSystem, ScreenSystem, Navigation (386 files) |
| `UI/` | GauntletUI, PrefabSystem, PSAI (285 files) |
| `Network/` | Diamond, Network, PlayerServices (147 files) |
| `Platform/` | PlatformService, Achievements, ModuleManager (69 files) |
| `Launcher/` | Launcher.Library, Launcher.Steam (40 files) |
| `ThirdParty/` | Newtonsoft.Json, Steamworks.NET, jose-jwt (1,081 files) |

### Quick Lookup Examples

```bash
# Find a class
find "E:/Decompiled_Bannerlord/" -name "DefaultPartyWageModel.cs"

# Search for a method across all decompiled source
grep -r "GetCharacterWage" "E:/Decompiled_Bannerlord/Campaign/"

# Browse a namespace
ls "E:/Decompiled_Bannerlord/Campaign/TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem/TaleWorlds/CampaignSystem/GameComponents/"
```

### When to Look Up TaleWorlds Source

1. **Harmony patches** — Verify the target method exists with the exact signature (name, params, return type, access modifier)
2. **GameModel overrides** — Verify the base class method you're overriding exists and has the expected signature
3. **Adapter interfaces** — Verify the TaleWorlds properties/methods being wrapped actually exist
4. **Any API call you're uncertain about** — v1.2 to v1.3 renamed/removed several APIs

### ILSpy MCP Fallback

If a type is not in the decompiled source, use the `ilspy` MCP tool:

```
mcp__ilspy__decompile_type(
  assembly: "E:\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\\bin\\Win64_Shipping_Client\\SandBox.dll",
  type: "SandBox.GameComponents.DefaultPartyWageModel"
)
```

**DLL path:** `E:\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\bin\Win64_Shipping_Client\`

| DLL | Contains |
|-----|----------|
| `TaleWorlds.CampaignSystem.dll` | Campaign, Hero, Clan, Kingdom, Settlement, MobileParty |
| `TaleWorlds.Core.dll` | BasicCharacterObject, ItemObject, Banner, FeatObject, GameModel base classes |
| `TaleWorlds.MountAndBlade.dll` | Agent, Mission, MissionBehavior, FormationClass |
| `SandBox.dll` | All `Default*Model` classes, SandboxAgentApplyDamageModel |
| `SandBox.View.dll` | MobilePartyVisual, MapScreen, view-layer classes |
| `StoryMode.dll` | StoryMode campaign behaviors |

If neither source is available, mark API usages as `UNVERIFIED` rather than guessing.
