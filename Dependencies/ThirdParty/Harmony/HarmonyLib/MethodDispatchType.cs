	/// This is the built-in form of late binding (a.k.a. dynamic binding) and is the default dispatching mechanic in C#.
	/// This directly corresponds with the <see cref="F:System.Reflection.Emit.OpCodes.Callvirt" /> instruction.
	/// </para>
	///     <para>
	/// For virtual (including overriden) methods, the instance type's most-derived/overriden implementation of the method is called.
	/// For non-virtual (including static) methods, same behavior as <see cref="F:HarmonyLib.MethodDispatchType.Call" />: the exact specified method implementation is called.
	/// </para>
	///     <para>
	/// Note: This is not a fully dynamic dispatch, since non-virtual (including static) methods are still called non-virtually.
	/// A fully dynamic dispatch in C# involves using
	/// the <see href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/reference-types#the-dynamic-type"><c>dynamic</c> type</see>
	/// (actually a fully dynamic binding, since even the name and overload resolution happens at runtime), which <see cref="T:HarmonyLib.MethodDispatchType" /> does not support.

	/// <summary>Call the method using static dispatching, regardless of whether method is virtual (including overriden) or non-virtual (including static)</summary>
	/// <remarks>
	///     <para>
	/// a.k.a. non-virtual dispatching, early binding, or static binding.
	/// This directly corresponds with the <see cref="F:System.Reflection.Emit.OpCodes.Call" /> instruction.
	/// </para>
	///     <para>
	/// For both virtual (including overriden) and non-virtual (including static) methods, the exact specified method implementation is called, without virtual/override mechanics.
